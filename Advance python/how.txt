How It Works
Log Reading:

The generator read_logs() reads the log file line by line, avoiding memory overload.
Parsing Logs:

parse_log() uses a regex to extract structured data from each log entry (timestamp, level, message).
Database Handling:

The DatabaseManager class ensures efficient database operations using a context manager.
Concurrent Processing:

Multiple log files are processed concurrently using multithreading.
Execution Logging:

The log_execution decorator tracks the start and end times of key functions.
